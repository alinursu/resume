## Function Grapher

**Â© 2019**



&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Function Grapher** is a Windows Desktop application written in C++, containing a minimalistic and intuitive GUI. The goal of the application is to help students to visualise any mathematical function's graph, for a given domain.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The application can show the graph of mathematical functions which contains arithmetic operations, logarithmic, square root, exponential and trigonometric functions, and mathematical constants (PI, Euler's constant, etc.).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A demo of the app can be seen in the "FILM EXEMPLU.mp4" file.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project was made as a team, for a homework, the other members of the team being:
