## PromoBot

**Â© 2019**


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The project was made in order to obtain the Digital Skills Certificate in the last year of high school.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **PromoBot** is a Desktop application written in Python where a user can search for discounted products in a certain online shop. The search is made using specified criterias, such as keywords, product categories, maximum price, etc. The application has support both for Windows and Linux.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the project contains a system which notifies the user if the same product had a smaller price in past, the data being store in a database. If the found product had a smaller price in the past, the generated HTML file will contain a message to inform the user.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **The project might be outdated (some HTML tags used for web scrapping might need some changes).**
